# Object-Detection-Alert-System-YOLOv8-OpenCV-Tkinter
This project is a real-time object detection and tracking system built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It not only detects objects from a webcam feed but also provides audio alerts whenever an object is detected. Additionally, it includes a Tkinter-based GUI control panel to start, stop, or quit detection with ease.
